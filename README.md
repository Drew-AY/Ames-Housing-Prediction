# Ames-Housing-Prediction

This is project aims to predict housing prices in Ames, IA. An 80 feature dataset provides comprehensive descriptions of each house sold and is sourced to train and build models using the Random forest and gradient boosting algorithms. Multiple feature engineering  and hyperparameter tuning work are carried out to control the dimensionality, constrain the model and deliver the most accurate and yet generalizable results possible. Both random forest and gradient boosting algorithms produced models with accuracy exceeding 90%
