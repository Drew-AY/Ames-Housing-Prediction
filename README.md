# Ames-Housing-Prediction

This project aims to predict housing prices in Ames, IA. An 80 feature dataset (both numerical and categorical) which provides comprehensive descriptions of each house and its corresponding sale price sold is sourced to train and build models using the Random forest and gradient boosting algorithms. Multiple feature engineering iterations and hyperparameter tuning work are carried out to reduce the dimensionality, constrain the model and deliver the most accurate and yet generalizable results possible according to the error metrics chosen (MAPE & RMSE). Both random forest and gradient boosting algorithms produced models with accuracy(100-MAPE) exceeding 90% and could predict sale prices with average errors less than $25,000.
